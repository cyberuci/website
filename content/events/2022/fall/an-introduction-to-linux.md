We'll be going over the basics on how to use Linux and why you should use it for certain applications, like server hosting. Furthermore, we’ll also help you set up a basic web server. Bring a laptop with a virtual machine software, like VMWare, and download our VM image for VMWare below before coming if you'd like to follow along.

If you need any help setting up the VM, feel free to ask for assistance by joining our Discord below.
