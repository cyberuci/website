We will give an overview of what the competition is like and what you can hope to learn in CCDC practices. If you attended our Careers in Cybersecurity presentation, you know that it's a great opportunity to gain experience, so feel free to come no matter your skill level. You will also have the chance to talk to the team that competed last year and ask them for more details. Hope to see you all there!
